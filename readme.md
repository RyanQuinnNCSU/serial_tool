## 1. What is deBUGger?
Serial is a common method of communication for embedded systems and IOT products from desktop computers. The deBUGger GUI removes the repetitive work of setting serial setting and writing data bytes by saving this information into json profiles. Other key features of this program are summarized below.
- Scan for serial devices (COM ports)
- Converting from HEX, DEC, ASCII
- Automatically send all serial command in a list.
- Write serial log to files
> Note: deBUGger is only supported on Windows, sorry MAC and Linux users.
"deBUGger" is an open source program, meaning you are free to modify the program and add additional features. See section 8 for more details on modifying the Python source code.
